      <img src="assets/images/portfolio-pic.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Sebastian Hernandez">

      <p>I am an inspired full-stack web developer, recently graduated from UNCC's full-stack bootcamp. My background consists of a lot of college education and different occupations. 
        From being a pre-dental and psychology student, a musician, to being a hands-on automotive and bicycle enthusiast. I'm always curious to explore new fields and web development has really grown in me.</p>
      <p>My goal is to enter the field of web development as a Jr full-stack developer, find my preferred area of interest and grow with an employer to master my skills in this astonishing field.</p>
      <p>My journey through the UNCC Coding bootcamp has been an experience that has taught me great team work, coordinating to meet deadlines and always helping each other in the process of developing applications.</p>
